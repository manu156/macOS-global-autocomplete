# System-Wide Autocomplete for macOS

An autocomplete prompt app for macOS that learns what as you type and works in **all text fields** system-wide!

The idea was to have a small, global popup in your menubar or as a transparent dropdown,
where autocomplete suggestions are provided based on **all words ever typed on the computer**.

Unfoturnately this just has too many downsides.  You're essentially continually keylogging
yourself for minor convenience, and it has the potential to reveal passwords or embarrassing
information in your typing history to anyone who can see your screen.

However, if you don't type anything embarrasing and have eschewed typing passwords in favor of 
a password manager, hack away, the code is free for all to use.

## Install

**WARNING: INSTALLING THIS PACKAGE IS DANGEROUS, IT'S EFFECTIVELY A KEYLOGGER THAT WRITES EVERYTHING YOU TYPE IN PLAIN TEXT TO /var/log/keystroke.log.**
**DO NOT INSTALL THIS UNLESS YOU ARE OK WITH COMPLETELY PWN'ING EVERYTHING YOU DO ON YOUR COMPUTER FOR THE SAKE OF MILD PRODUCTIVITY GAINS**

### 1. Install BitBar: https://getbitbar.com/

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
brew install redis pypy
brew services start redis
pypy -m "pip" install --upgrade pykeyboard redis

git clone https://github.com/pirate/macOS-global-autocomplete.git
cd macOS-global-autocomplete
```
### 3. Set up macOS-global-autocomplete

Edit `bitbar-autocomplete.1s.sh` to point to the correct path of the git repo you just cloned.
```
/usr/local/bin/pypy /path/to/macOS-global-autocomplete/autocomplete.py
```

Then copy it into your plugins folder to enable it in BitBar:
```bash
cp bitbar-autocomplete.1s.sh /path/to/bitbar/plugins/folder
```

### 4. Verify that it's working

```bash
tail -f /var/log/keystroke.log
```

And start typing to see if things show up...

## TODO:

 1. add helper script to train redis trie on /usr/share/dict/words, python standard library, etc.
 2. add config file to set insertion key commands
 3. finish insert code using `pyuserinput`
 4. add code to rotate /var/log/keystroke.log
 5. add hashing blacklist functionality to exclude obsenties, sensitive words, passwords, etc.
